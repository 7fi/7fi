A commissioned project for deadshot.io. Set in an old mining town in the far reaches of Alaska, this map has well balanced gameplay and a high level of detail. A collaboration with fellow artist Octodoodle, it features many unique areas including a mineshaft, sawmill, sleeping quarters, and many buildings throughout the town. The project is well optimized, and required many skills to create such as terrain creation, modeling, texturing, and general knowledge of level design and environment art.
