Includes custom triangle renderer, custom vector math class, and is based off Craig Reynold's flocking algorithm. This project and the assignments leading up to it taught me how to use Java and how to write better more structured code. I also ported the project to Javascript for the web.</div>

A collaboration with fellow artist Octodoodle, it features many unique areas including a mineshaft, sawmill, sleeping quarters, and many buildings throughout the town. The project is well optimized, and required many skills to create such as terrain creation, modelling, texturing, and general knowledge of level design and environment art.</p>

Even though it was never finished, much work was still put into it, including modelling and texturing several spacecraft, as well as making a few planets with custom terrain and assets. We developed a chunk system to help with performance, as well as many menus and interactions from scratch.  </p>
